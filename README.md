Create an android app

RSP 0.0

This is a simple Rock-Scissor-Paper game.

The apk is built by Android Studio 2.2.
RSP supports most of android devices with different android versions and screens.
I run it in Google Nexus5 and Sony Xperia Z5 Premium successfully.

To install  RSP on your android device, you should copy RSP00.apk in your phone storage. 
Then go to the file location click open to install.
If your phone says you cannot install unkonwn sources, you should allow your phone installation of apps from unknown sources. Take Android 6.0 for example, this setting is located in Setting-Security-Unkonwon sources.

After installation, click open RSP00.

To start, P1 first make a selection between Rock, Scissor and Paper.
Then P2 does a selection.
Finally click the "SHOW" button get the result.
To start a new game, click"Restart".


There is a BUG I haven't fix yet.

In next version, I would modify UI and fix a logical BUG.
